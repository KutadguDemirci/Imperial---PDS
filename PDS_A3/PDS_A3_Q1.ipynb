    "A cycle rental company has heard about the benefits of object oriented programming, and wants to use this programming paradigm to analyse its data. Your task is to use a test driven development approach to support the rental company and write classes and tests to represent and analyse the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data are contained in the csv file `trips.csv`. Each row in the file corresponds to one cycle trip and indicates when a trip starts and ends, if it is done by a member (paying a subscription fee) or a casual customer (not paying a subscription fee), and if the trip is done using an electric or non-electric ('classic') cycle. Each trip generates a profit for the company as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* No profit for a member trip of at most 45 minutes.\n",
    "* For a member trip, there is an overage fee of 0.10 GBP, so every additional minute (after the first 45) generates a profit of 0.10 GBP.\n",
    "* For a member trip with an electric cycle, there is an extra overage fee of 0.05 GBP (in addition to the 0.10 GBP).\n",
    "* For a casual trip, the base profit for every minute is 0.25 GBP.\n",
    "* For a casual trip with an electric cycle, the base profit goes up by an additional 0.15 GBP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement four classes in Python to represent the data above, as well as certain methods as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A class `CycleTrip` with five methods: \n",
    "    - A constructor `__init__` that instantiates a new object from a `start_time` string, an `end_time` string and a `ride_type` string (either \"classic\" or \"electric\"). The constructor should set three private attributes `_start_time`, `_end_time` (both being `Timestamp` objects) and a boolean `_is_electric` that is True when the `ride_type` is `electric` and False otherwise.\n",
    "    - A method `is_electric` that returns the value of the private attribute `_is_electric`.\n",
    "    - A method `get_start_day` that returns the name (as string) of the weekday of `_start_time`.\n",
    "    - A method `compute_profit` that computes the profit of this trip. This method will have no implementation, and will have to be overridden by the subclasses `MemberTrip` and `CasualTrip`.\n",
    "    - A `__str__` method to print the object. It prints the duration (difference between end and start time) and the profit related to this trip, and should indicate if it is an electric ride or not. For example, the object which is instantiated by `MemberTrip(\"2025-11-01 08:00\", \"2025-11-01 08:15\", \"classic\")` should print as \"CycleTrip: classic ride, 15.0 minutes, 0.0 profit\". \n",
    "2. A subclass `MemberTrip` of `CycleTrip` which overrides the method `compute_profit` and returns the profit for a member trip as explained at the beginning of this question.\n",
    "3. A subclass `CasualTrip` of `CycleTrip` which overrides the method `compute_profit` and returns the profit for a casual trip as explained at the beginning of this question. \n",
    "4. A class `CycleTripCollection` with five methods:\n",
    "    - A constructor `__init__` that instantiates a new object, and sets the private attribute `_trips` to an empty list and the private attribute `_daily_profits` to an empty dictionary (mapping weekday names to total profits on that day). \n",
    "    - A method `add` that takes as argument a `CycleTrip` object, adds it to the private attribute `_trips`, updates the dictionary `_daily_profits` by computing the profit of the trip and adding it to the total profits on that day so far.\n",
    "    - A method `get_trips` that returns the private attribute `_trips`.\n",
    "    - A method `get_daily_profits` that returns the private attribute `_daily_profits`.\n",
    "    - A `__str__` method to print the object. It should contain the total number of trips, the number of electric cycle trips and the daily profits. An example for such a string is \n",
    "\n",
    "    \"CyleTripCollection\n",
    "     -5 trips total, 2 electric trips,\n",
    "     -Daily profits: {'Friday': 1.0, 'Saturday': 25.0}\" \n",
