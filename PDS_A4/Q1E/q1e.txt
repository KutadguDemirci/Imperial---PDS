R in my opinion is a lot better in data manipulation, filtering and working with columnar data. Also getting data inside RStudio is incredibly straighforward.

The data manipulation tools of R is a lot better than pandas. In pandas, having to use loc and iloc for data manipulation or filtering/slicing is very confusing to both write and make sense when something doesn't work as expected.

Even though I am very used to Python and I feel friction when writing in R, the data manipulation tools of R were a lot easier to pick up compared to pandas.

The examples are from a previous assigment, where after working through the Python part first, I was surprised how fast I could get through the R part.
