    "Your task is to build a Python package that samples from a target density using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The (random walk) Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a method for generating samples from a probability distribution with pdf $\\pi$ when we cannot sample from it directly, but we can evaluate $\\pi$ (up to a constant). The algorithm constructs a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the probability distribution we want to sample from. We consider only pdf's on $\\mathbb{R}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the current state $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$, the algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Draw a candidate $y\\in\\mathbb{R}$ from the normal distribution $N(0,\\sigma^2)$ for a given $\\sigma^2>0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Compute the acceptance probability $\\alpha(x, y) = \\min(1,\\; \\pi(y)/\\pi(x))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Draw a value $z$ from the uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. If $z<\\alpha(x,y)$, then we accept the candidate $y$ and make it the current state. Otherwise, we reject $y$ and keep the current state $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeating this process yields a Markov chain that eventually behaves like draws from the distribution with density $\\pi$. We usually only keep samples after `burn_in` initial samples, so the chain has settled in a region where the target density has mass. We can use the samples to approximate e.g. expectations and histograms. An important performance metric is the `acceptance rate`, which is the number of accepted candidates divided by the number of total candidates. A reasonable acceptance rate in practice is typically between 0.3 and 0.5, as a smaller acceptance rate indicates that the chain moves only rarely (and is possibly stuck), while larger acceptance rates imply that the proposals are too close to the current state and the chain moves slowly.
