    "## Why NumPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "You will occassionaly interact with NumPy directly in typical day to day tasks as a data scientist. However, it is the underlying fabric of many higher level libraries which are the bread and butter of typical workflows (e.g. Pandas). To work with those libraries it can help to understand NumPy. Furthermore, NumPy makes use of underlying code optimisation techniques to make linear algebra (and elementwise operations in general) 10-100x faster as long as you properly utilise the library (write so called 'vectorized' code). Lastly, you can rely on the underlying implementation to be correct instead of cooking up your own."

It is important to be clear on which dimension represents what, the convention of rows first then columns is the most common way of representing 2D matrices in NumPy, i.e. you have a list of rows, so the first index passed chooses a row."

This means to get the nth element we must supply an index of (n-1).

Here are some examples:\n",
